1. Overview
===========

OCaml-counterparty is a library offering an OCaml interface to the official
Counterparty client API [1].  It works by making JSON-RPC calls over the
network to a running coubterpartyd daemon offering the client API.

Please refer to ocaml-bitcoin as this is pretty much a fork of its' library structure.
